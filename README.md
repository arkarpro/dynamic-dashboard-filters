# Dynamic Dashboard Filters

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic dashboard using Python and Streamlit. The dashboard features **Dependent (Cascading) Filters** allowing users to select one filter and automatically update the available options in the next filter.

## Features
- Dynamic filters based on user selections.
- Displays the population data for various regions, districts, and townships.
- Includes male and female population metrics with totals shown dynamically.
- Demo app is live and accessible to try.

## How to Use
1. Explore the dataset presented on the dashboard.
2. Select your desired **State/Region**, **District**, and **Township** from the dropdown filters.
3. The data will automatically update based on your selection, showing relevant statistics.
4. View the male and female population totals dynamically.

## Future Plans
- Plan to improve the current dashboard by incorporating **Titanic Dashboard** and **Target vs Actual Dashboard** to create a more comprehensive dynamic dashboard.
- Developing a new dashboard based on **Social Media Data** with dependent filters.
- Source code and demo apps will be shared on **GitHub** and **Streamlit Cloud** soon.
